Hello! You have probably stumbled upon this repository of mine. I actually created this project with the help of The Odin Project, StackOverflow, Youtube, and ChatGPT.
Honestly, it was really hard. I struggled a lot on the structure of the sheet, as well as the styling of it. I know it looks simple, but trust me, I poured so much effort in it! I googled some CSS styles as well as techniques on how I can achieve the grid. Honestly, I learned a lot from this project. The DOM and Events aren't that confusind anymore. I knew that I would get into this point. That I'll finally grasp the essence of this project.

Well, aside from learning, I 100% enjoyed this Etch-A-Sketch project! It was so fun playing with it, but building it was challenging. But that's the point. Challenges in life never fails to surprise us. And one thing is for sure, everyone can get through it!
